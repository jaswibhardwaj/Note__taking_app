# My Notes App

## Project Overview

This is a simple, interactive note-taking app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to write, save, and restore notes easily.  The app features a clean and user-friendly interface with a light and dark mode toggle.

## Features

- **Add Notes:** Create new notes quickly with the "Add New Note" button.
- **Delete Notes:** Remove unwanted notes with a confirmation prompt.
- **Restore Deleted Notes:** Recover accidentally deleted notes.
- **Theme Toggle:** Switch between light and dark mode.
- **Random Color-Coded Notes:** Each new note is assigned a random background color for visual organization.
- **Date and Time Tracking:** (Future Enhancement) Each note will be timestamped.
- **Persistent Local Storage:** Notes are saved locally in your browser, so you don't lose them when you close the app.

## Files

- **index.html:** The main HTML file that structures the app's layout, including the header, note container, buttons, and links to CSS and JavaScript files.
- **index2.html:**  A welcome page that provides information about the application. It includes a brief description and a button to proceed to the main note-taking interface.
- **index.css:** The stylesheet that defines the visual presentation of the app, such as colors, fonts, layout, and responsive design.
- **app.js:**  The JavaScript file that handles the app's logic, including adding, deleting, restoring notes, theme toggling, random color generation, and local storage management.

## Future Enhancements
